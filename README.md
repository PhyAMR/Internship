# CMB


Here I wil place the code from my internship

The main goal is to make a program that using MCMC to infer the parameters of a cosmological model, obtain the $C_l$ coeficients and compare them with the ones obtained from the Planck mission, that includes computing the likelihood of each model given the data.

The useless folder contains code that either was experimental, or served other pourposes (ie cleaning files that appears because of using WSL)

Some of the folders might be missing, this is due to its large size, but they can be obtained in via the plancks web.
